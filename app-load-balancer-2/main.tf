# Client: Sends a request.
# ALB: Receives the request.
# Listener: Listens on specified ports and routes traffic based on rules.
# Listener Rules: Define conditions for routing to target groups.
# Target Group: Receives traffic and forwards it to ECS tasks.
# ECS Tasks: Handle the request and return a response.

# you can configure an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) listener to route traffic to different target groups based on specific conditions, such as path patterns, host headers, HTTP methods, or even query string parameters. This is commonly done by setting up listener rules within the aws_lb_listener_rule resource, rather than directly within the aws_lb_listener resource

# Basic Listener Setup: Use aws_lb_listener to define the listener with a default action.
# Conditional Routing: Use aws_lb_listener_rule to define rules that route traffic to different target groups based on conditions like path patterns or host headers.
# Multiple Target Groups: You can route traffic to different target groups depending on the rules specified.
