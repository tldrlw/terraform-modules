# ^ The route for the destination CIDR 10.0.0.0/16 was automatically created by AWS when the Client VPN endpoint cvpn-endpoint-0b564f3fc6065c40e was associated with the subnet subnet-0cc7e4838a47117e3. This default route, of type Nat, ensures traffic from VPN clients is properly routed through the associated subnet. Since AWS handles this route creation automatically, defining an aws_ec2_client_vpn_route resource in Terraform would result in duplicate route errors during provisioning. This redundancy occurs because Terraform tries to create a route that already exists, leading to conflicts. Therefore, itâ€™s unnecessary to manage this route manually in Terraform.
